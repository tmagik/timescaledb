# TimescaleDB Changelog

## 0.9.0 (2018-02-15)

**High-level changes**
* Support for multiple extension versions on different databases in the
same PostgreSQL instance. This allows different databases to be updated
independently and provides for smoother updates between versions. No
more spurious errors in the log as the extension is being
updated, and new versions no longer require a restart of the database.
* Significant refactoring to simplify and improve codebase, including
improvements to error handling, security/permissions, and more.
* Corrections to edge-case scenarios involving dropping schemas,
hypertables, dimensions, and more
* Correctness improvements through propagating reloptions from main
table to chunk tables and blocking `ONLY` commands that try to alter
hypertables (i.e., changes should be applied to chunks as well)
* Addition of a `migrate_data` option to `create_hypertable` to allow
non-empty tables to be turned into hypertables without separate
creation & insertion steps. Note, this option may take a while if the
original table has lots of data.
* Support for `ALTER TABLE RENAME CONSTRAINT`
* Support for adjusting the number of partitions for a space dimension
* Improvements to tablespace handling

## 0.1.0 (2017-06-28)

**IMPORTANT NOTE**

Starting with this release, TimescaleDB will now
support upgrading between extension versions using the typical
`ALTER EXTENSION` command, unless otherwise noted in future release notes. This
important step should make it easier to test TimescaleDB and be able
to get the latest benefits from new versions of TimescaleDB. If you
were previously using a version with the `-beta` tag, you will need
to `DROP` any databases currently using TimescaleDB and re-create them
in order to upgrade to this new version. To backup and migrate data,
use `pg_dump` to save the table schemas and `COPY` to write hypertable
data to CSV for re-importing after upgrading is complete. We describe
a similar process on [our docs](http://docs.timescale.com/getting-started/setup/migrate-from-postgresql#different-db).

**High-level changes**
